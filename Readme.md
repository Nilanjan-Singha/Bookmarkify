# BOOKMARKIFY 

Bookmarkify is a clean, minimal bookmarking platform designed to help you manage your favorite websites and tools in a simpler, more organized way. While tools like Raindrop already exist, they’ve grown increasingly bulky and less intuitive over time. That’s why I built Bookmarkify — a faster, smoother alternative focused on usability without the clutter.
